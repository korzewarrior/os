make desktop icons able to be moved around (light gridding, no overlap)

add folders
folder browser / file browser

turn off highlighting on the desktop or icons

discord 'app' (web view just dont have the url bar showing so maybe a clone of browser app minus url bar?)

text editor app

the menu bar, when just on the desktop and no window, should not have the "file" or "window" drop down those dont have anything we can do in the desktop mode they should just be removed in this mode 

apps should be resizable by grabbing any of the sides or bottom not top where the title bar is) not just the corners
grabbing a side should grow it in that direction
grabbing a corner should grow in both directions

double clicking title bar should maximize the window
